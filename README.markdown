*a simple yet configurable toolkit that works with Kinect and interprets gesture recognition data into MIDI signals*

[video demos](http://www.youtube.com/user/apolotary)

**v 0.3** (current version)

- Simplified gesture recognition
- Additions in MIDI-class

**v 0.2**

- Kinect skeletal tracking basics
- Interpreting hands coordinates as notes

**v 0.1**

- Basic MIDI-interaction
- Some base classes

for Kinect and WPF-related stuff I use: 

- KinectSDK 
- Code4Fun Kinect Toolkit  
- Examples from KinectforWindowsSDK series

for MIDI-related stuff I use this awesome library: [midi-dot-net](http://code.google.com/p/midi-dot-net/) 

for virtual port I'm currently using [loopbe1](http://nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html)

however there's also a good analogue for it: [midiyoke](http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm)
